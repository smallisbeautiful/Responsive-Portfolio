      <p>
          As a native of Hong Kong, I understand Chinese culture and speak both Cantonese and Mandarin.  
          While I am proud of my cultural heritage, my curiosity and respect for different cultures have 
          led me to the U.K. and the U.S. where I have thrived.  As a lifelong learner, I have earned 
          six academic and professional degrees in the U.S., U.K., and Hong Kong, including degrees in 
          business and law.

          Fascinated by the latest developments in technology, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, 
          and machine learning, I have received various diplomas in fintech and data science in 2018.  I 
          am excited that in 2019 I will be able to add web development to my skillset.  Going forward, 
          leveraging my extensive experience in the corporate world at the management level, I hope to add 
          value by combining my multicultural background with my passion for entrepreneurship and interest 
          in technology.

          When I am not working, I can be found practicing yoga and working out in the gym.  I have also 
          trained for the Chicago Triathlon in 2012 to raise funds for a charitable organization.  In addition, 
          I am a huge fan of Western and Chinese operas as well as an enthusiastic student of flamenco dance 
          and Argentine tango.
